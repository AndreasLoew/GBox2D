# GBox2d

This is the wrapper for box2d + cocos2d I use in my own game projects.

It is design to work with my PhysicsEditor to create the shapes:

To get started check out the tutorial I wrote for Ray Wenderlich's Blog:

http://www.codeandweb.com/monkejump

It teaches you how to create a complete game from scratch for iOS

## Current status

It's not yet complete - e.g. joints are not yet supported.

GBox2d is now updated to work with cocos2d 2.0 release with the provided box2d 

The MonkeyJump tutorial will be updated to cocos2d 2.x soon ;-)
